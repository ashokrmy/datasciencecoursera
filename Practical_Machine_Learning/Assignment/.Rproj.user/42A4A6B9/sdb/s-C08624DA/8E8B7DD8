    "contents" : "# Prediction Assignment Submission: Instructions Help\n\n# Please apply the machine learning algorithm you built to each of the 20 test cases in the testing data set. \n# For more information and instructions on how to build your model see the prediction assignment writeup. \n# For each test case you should submit a text file with a single capital letter (A, B, C, D, or E) corresponding \n# to your prediction for the corresponding problem in the test data set. You get 1 point for each correct answer. \n# You may submit up to 2 times for each problem. I know it is a lot of files to submit. \n# It may be helpful to use the following function to create the files. \n# If you have a character vector with your 20 predictions in order for the 20 problems. \n# So something like (note these are not the right answers!):\n  \nanswers = rep(\"A\", 20)\n# then you can load this function by copying and pasting it into R:\n  \npml_write_files = function(x){\n    n = length(x)\n    for(i in 1:n){\n      filename = paste0(\"problem_id_\",i,\".txt\")\n      write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)\n    }\n}\n\n# then create a folder where you want the files to be written. Set that to be your working directory and run:\n\npml_write_files(answers)\n\n# and it will create one file for each submission. \n# Note: if you use this script, please make sure the files that get written out have one character \n# each with your prediction for the corresponding problem ID. I have noticed the script produces \n# strange results if the answers variable is not a character vector.",
